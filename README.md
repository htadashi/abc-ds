### Setup
Install MATLAB (tested with R2023a).

Install the required MathWorks toolboxes:
Control System Toolbox,
Robust Control Toolbox,
Optimization Toolbox,
Signal Processing Toolbox,
Symbolic Math Toolbox,
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.

Install the required third party tools:
[YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/),
[PENLAB](https://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/kocvara/penlab/)+[PENBMI](http://www.penopt.com/penbmi.html),
[MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/),
[GUROBI](https://www.gurobi.com/),
(Optional for plotting: [crameri colormaps](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/68546-crameri-perceptually-uniform-scientific-colormaps)).

> **Note**
> Make sure that the non-toolbox paths are before/on top of the toolbox paths.

Run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/martinschonger/abc-ds.git
cd abc-ds
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Usage
Open the `abc-ds` folder in MATLAB.

Configure the desired experiments in `main2.m` and run this script.

Check the `output` folder for results and logs.

(Optionally, recreate the plots from the paper with `generate_plots.m`, and the animations from the video with `generate_plots_video.m`.)
