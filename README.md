# ABC-DS: obstacle Avoidance with Barrier-Certified polynomial Dynamical Systems (PENLAB only version)

This is a modified version of [ABC-DS](https://github.com/martinschonger/abc-ds) that runs without requiring the PENBMI solver.
If you have access to PENBMI, it is **strongly recommended** to use the [original version](https://github.com/martinschonger/abc-ds) by Martin Schonger instead.
